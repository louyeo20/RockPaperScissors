# RockPaperScissors

Created a Rock Paper Scissors game from scratch with no full walkthrough advice. 
I stylized the game myself before figuring out how to do the logic part of the game.
It took me a while to solve the logic part with some mentor help. 
Now i have some better understanding of Javascript, particuarly variable shadowing and how to call the shadowed variable in the other function.
